## inheritance - Restaurant.java, Reviews.java, Shop.java, Theather.java, Store.java(super class), Reviewer.java(Interface)
- Created the restaurant and reviews class which takes in a restaurant name and has a review section uniquely for each restuarant and therefore rates them accordingly to a customer's taste or experience.
- Created a theater class for users to add movies, remove movies and be able to review a movie
- I implemented an Interface so that all the other class inheritances can access it.
